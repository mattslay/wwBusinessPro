The wwBusinessPro VCX class library is documented to a Windows Help File (CHM) Using a FoxPro documentation tool called PDM (Project Documenting Machine), and the HTML Help Workshop from Microsoft.

You can find the PDM config files in the Documentation\PDM PDM folder should you wish to re-build the CHM help files.

See: http://gorila.netlab.cz/_pdm.html for the PDM tool.

In the Help File, you will find documentation for both the wwBusiness from West Wind, and the wwBusinessPro library wrapper written by Matt Slay.
